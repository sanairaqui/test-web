This is provided by the <code>&lt;site-layout></code> component which lives in <code>~/src/components/site-layout</code>. This component makes use of Marko's ability to <a href="http://markojs.com/docs/core-tags/#layouts-with-nested-attributes">pass content using nested attributes</a>.</p><p></p></section><section><h2>Styles</h2><p>As you can see, this site looks quite nice. That's because Marko <a href="http://markojs.com/docs/components/#supporting-files">pulls in stylesheets</a> next to a Marko template. Try editing the contents of <code>~/src/components/site-layout/style.css</code>. &#128132;</p></section><section><h2>Images</h2><p>We also have the Marko logo in the header. The image file lives at <code>site-layout/logo.png</code>, right next to <code>site-layout/index.marko</code> which references it using a relative path: <code>&lt;img src="./logo.png"/></code>.</p><p>And this works for all resources, not just images, which allows you to keep your resources next to the templates which use them. &#128077;</p></section><script src="/layouts-96ab0122.js"></script>
